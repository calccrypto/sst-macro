Commit b7ace3fadce629e83138f2b4def31ccb3b890507 is the clean Lulesh
2.0.3 download.  You can diff off that version to see *all* changes
made in the skeletonization process.

With no LULESH_SST_* macros enabled, the modified version of Lulesh
should reduce to the original.

The macro LULESH_SST_MODS can be enabled to implement basic changes
to Lulesh that are required for an apples-to-apples comparison with
the SST model.

The macro LULESH_SST_SIM, when paired with LULESH_SST_MODS, can be
enabled to replace the real Lulesh computation with an SST simulation
that counts flops.  This mode does not support OpenMP.

Skeletonization of the alternative data layout, lulesh_tuple.h, is
incomplete.
